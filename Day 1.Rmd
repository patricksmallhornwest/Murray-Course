Murray R Course Day 1

Git - version control system. Like onedrive or time machine - it keeps older versions of your work. Instead of keeping multiple evrsions with different names. Workspace - Staging area - Local repository. Workspace = your files. Staging area = Files you want to keep multiple versions of, not safe yet but Git knows about it. Local repository = Saved files. Repositories are generally on the cloud I think. Once you change a saved file it would make  modified state. Repository can be local or remote.

Set up Git with these in command prompt (windows) or Terminal (Mac)
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

Make Git repository in R studio:
First make a new project - which is a series of tabs all in the same folder for organization. Save it as a git one then it is a Git project.

Two files will be created in the Project folder. The project file, which isn't for sharing, just your info. And the gitignor file. This file contains all the bits of info about what you don't, under any circumstances, want to share/upload. It's hidden so yu won't see it in your folder but useful. Can prevent data from accidentally being shared, or junk files from wasting space and cluttering.

EG ADD FILE. Called analysis.R and code below:

x=seq(1, 10, len=1)
y=40*2 + rnorm(10,0,5)
plot(x,y)


To stage them, click the staged checkbox under the git tabe for each file. Then commit to commit them. This will bring up a window with all the changes from previous commit. Must put in a message in the message section to indicate what changed.

Once committed everything is safe. I can delete this whole file, change everything, whatever, and it's safe (i.e. I can get it back)

Git is stored in hash code (like passwords). Git makes a unique hash code (SHA code) and then compares it to an updated one. If the same then nothing has changed. If it's different then can update.

If you clikc the clock under Git it will show all the past commits/saves

Making changes: Make any change and save it and it will appear in the Git tab. 


The mantra of Git is to commit often. Commits are cheap and help you go back as much as you like.
For the first 30 days after saving it it will keep all versions of each file. After 30 days it will only keep the things that changed.

Making a tag - say for the version for a final manuscript. Open shell under the cog in the git tab (this opens the terminal) then type in git tag -a <tag> -m <message> (git tag -a 'V.1' -m 'Version 1')


Going back:
1. Checkout - go back a few commits and start a new branch
2. Reset - Goes back and deletes newer commits from where you are (don't do much and definetely not on the cloud)
3. Revert - Reverts back to older branch while keeping newer ones (better for collaborations)

Doing it
1. Checkout - in the SHELL type git checkout SHA/tag and this will revert back to where we were before
2. Reset - not doing because dangerous
3. Revert - only goes back one at a time. Don't need to know where we want to go back to, just that we want to go back one from somewhere. Type into SHELL: git revert HEAD --no-edit. Then when check history there is now another one that shows it reverting back

Branching - adding new features without disrupting main code base. How do we fork? Type into Shell: git checkout -b <Name> (this case experimental). Then typed mean (x) into analysis page. WHen look at history there is an experimental branch as well as the master branch, and the experimental branch has the mean (x) in it.

Then back on analysis.R where the mean (x) was removed, add mean(y). Then save and commit with checkout from "git checkout master" and you have a new node. Save this one and check in the history and you will see both branches going.

Merging branches - bring them back together. Go to branch you want to be main branch. Checkout that one, i.e. make sure head is that branch (in this case and usually Master). Type "git merge Experimental" (name of second branch) and it will merge the two. Now I click on analysis.R and they both pop up. But with error because can't overwrite each other. We have to choose between conflict.

x=seq(1, 10, len=1)
y=40*2 + rnorm(10,0,5)
plot(x,y)
<<<<<<< HEAD
mean (y)

=======
summary (x)
mean(x)
>>>>>>> Experimental

This means conflict between master/head file and Experimental file. Must manually delete the bit you don't want.
In history you can see the whole chain that you've been through, including the branches and how they merged.

  
GitHub:  
Set up an online repository in GitHub. Set up account and then new repository. To link it with your computers one type into Shell:  git remote add origin https://github.com/patricksmallhornwest/Murray-Course.git. Then: git push -u origin master (this is the master branch)
